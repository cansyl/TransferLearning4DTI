# Transfer-Learning

Grid search for hyper-parameter values is performed over the number of hidden layers {1, 2, 3, 4}, the hidden layer size {64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096}, the learning rate {0.01, 0,001, 0.0001}, the dropout rate {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}, the number of training epochs {20, 40, 50, 80, 100}, and the batch sizes {64, 128, 256, 512}.
